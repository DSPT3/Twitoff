# Twitoff

Wrote a fun web application for comparing and predicting tweets from Twitter Users using the Twitter Developer API.

It is deployed on heroku and can be viewed at <https://my-twitoff-app.herokuapp.com>

If you get an error while trying to add a user, it is due to the API taking longer than two minutes to load the Users Tweets. I am working on a better fix for this but until then you can click the back arrow and refresh the page. Your user will be there and you can click on their name to see their tweets. They will also be available on your drop down menu to compare tweets and predict which user is more likely to say it. It is very simple but very functional for my first attempt at deploying a flask app to Heroku.
